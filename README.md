Ayush Rai's Portfolio Website
===============================

<!-- ![Portfolio Preview](https://vandit-shah.me/images/og-image.png)\ -->

A modern, single-page portfolio website built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, showcasing my skills, projects, and journey as a full-stack web developer. This project is designed to be easily customizable via a data.json file, allowing anyone to adapt it for their own portfolio by simply updating the data.

🚀 Features
-----------

-   **Single-Page Design**: A sleek, scrollable layout with sections for Home, Skills, Projects, About Me, and Contact.
-   **Dedicated Projects Page**: A /projects route to display all projects, categorized by tech stack (e.g., Full Stack, React, Next.js, Blockchain) with a filtering feature.
-   **Modern Techy Theme**: Dark background with purple accents, monospaced fonts, and gradient borders for a developer-centric aesthetic.
-   **SEO Optimized**: Includes meta tags, schema markup, and a sitemap for better search engine ranking (e.g., optimized for "Ayush Rai").
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across devices using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
-   **Interactive Elements**:
    -   Navbar with active link highlighting based on scroll position.
    -   Category filtering on the Projects page with a fade-in animation for project cards.
    -   Video background in the hero section with an image fallback for unsupported devices.
-   **Customizable Data**: All content (navbar text, projects, skills, etc.) is abstracted into a data.json file for easy customization.
-   **Performance Optimized**:
    -   Server-side rendering (SSR) for most components to reduce client-side JavaScript.
    -   Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
    -   Compressed video and image assets for faster load times.
-   **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA attributes for the mobile menu and semantic HTML for better screen reader support.
